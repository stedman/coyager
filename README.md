# Coyager

> TL;DR This is a "fan art" font based on the nifty ASCII display face at <https://shoptalkshow.com>.

While having fun with the kids and the [BirdFont editor](https://birdfont.org/), I decided to take a crack at turning the [ShopTalk Show](https://shoptalkshow.com/)'s cool retro ASCII heading type into a font.

I used [Sketch](https://sketch.com/) to convert the ASCII bits (in their first choice for font-family: Consolas) to outlines and then exported as individual SVGs. These SVGs were then imported into BirdFont and tweaked into a monospace before exporting to usable fonts. It took just a couple of hours of learning and dabbling to create what you see here.

The origin story for the COYAGER name can be found at the end of <https://stedman.github.io/coyager/>.
